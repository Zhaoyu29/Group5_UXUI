                base (first base, second base, third base and home base) at each
                corner. Each base is 90 feet away from the next. In the middle
                of the diamond, 60.5 feet away from home plate is the pitchers
                mound.

                by a wall, between 325 and 450 feet away from the home plate.
                There are also two "foul lines" which extend to the wall from
                the first base and third base lines, and at the end of each foul
                line where it meets the outside wall. there's a huge "foul pole"
                to show which long hits are fair and which are foul.

                pitching mound and throws the ball to the hitter who stands at
                home plate. The hitter tries to put the ball into play by
                hitting it inside the foul lines (the ball must go in front of
                first or third base and first land inside the foul lines) and
                then running to first base without being tagged out. He can stop
                at first base if he wishes, or continue to second, third or home

                If a hitter stops on a base (becoming a "base runner"), then he

                see him running, but any team-mates on other bases running as
